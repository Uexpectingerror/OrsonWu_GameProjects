======About======
Your favorite forest animals have picked up a new hobby. Painting! Except they will need to use some strategy and a bit of fire power to conquer the opposing team. Currently you can play as one of 3 characters with special paint centric abilities to control the arena and push to paint over the opposing team's base! One vs one battles have never been this hairy!
